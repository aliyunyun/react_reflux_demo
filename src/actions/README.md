# About this folder
This folder will hold all of your **flux** actions if you are using flux.
You can include actions into your components or stores like this:

```javascript
let react = require('react/addons');
let MMyComponent extends React.Component {
       constructor(props) {
         super(props);
         MyAction.exampleMethod();
       }yAction = require('actions/MyAction');
class 
}
```
